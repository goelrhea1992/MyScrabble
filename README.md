# MyScrabble

During my formative years as a Computer Sciencist, I fell in love with Python during my first year - and I haven't looked back ever since!

I created this simple Scrabble console game, which could be a great reference guide for any new Python programmers.

This was also my first time writing unit tests. Hope this helps!

Running instructions:

	python MyScrabble.py
